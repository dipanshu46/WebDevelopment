    <!-- What is CSS? -->
    <h3>CSS :- </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>It gives style to raw HTML</li>
        <li>It is used to give style to our webpages</li>
        <li>It is used to make websites responsive</li>
        <li>CSS is used to provide design to the structure provided by the HTML to a website</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- How is CSS written? -->
    <h3>CSS Syntax :- </h3>
    <p>
        selector { property : value; } <br> <!-- This is the general format -->
        For Ex: p { color : blue; } <br>
        here, <br>
        p is the paragraph selector (a selector can be for a class / id / element tag directly), <br> 
        color is the property that tells the colour of the text, <br>
        blue is the value that tells us that the colour should be set to blue. <br>
    </p>

    <!-- Where CSS can be written? -->
    <h3>Three ways to add CSS to the markup (HTML Code) :-</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline CSS :- </li>
        CSS is added to the element directly using style attribute.
        <li>Internal CSS :-</li>
        CSS is written inside the head element in &lt;style&gt; tags.
        <li>External CSS :-</li>
        CSS is kept seperately inside a .css style sheet
    </ul>
