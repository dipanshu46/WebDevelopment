    COMPASS - 
        Compass is a GUI for mongodb. After starting a mongod process, instead of connecting it through the shell using mongo in windows and mongosh in Linux based OS, we can connect to it using Compass.
    
    Installation, for windows has been completed while installing mongodb (recommended settings).
    For Linux based OS, 
        1) Follow the url : https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
        2) In tools on the left side click on the MongoDB Compass (GUI)
        3) Scroll down a little you'll find version, Platform and Package.

        4) Click on Download.
        5) Open terminal and cd to downloads where your .deb file for mongodb-compass is present.
        6) Run command :$ sudo dpkg -i (filename.deb), and hit Enter.
