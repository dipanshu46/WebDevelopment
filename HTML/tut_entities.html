    <!-- Entities -->
    <!-- Entities are used to print reserved keywords or symbols or to print special characters that are not available on a keyboard. -->
    <!-- Entities start with & and end with ; -->
    <!-- They are basically special characters or escape sequences in HTML to do a specific task -->

    <div class="container">
        <p>This is a           paragraph</p>
        <!-- HTML chops extra spaces to one single blankspace. To deal with this we use Entities like the one that follows in another paragraph -->
    </div>

    <div class="container">

        <!-- &nbsp; is an entity. Non Breaking Space. It is used to print spaces. -->
        <p>This is another &nbsp; &nbsp; paragraph with two spaces</p>
        <!-- See how many spaces has it added now to the screen -->

        <p>Paragraph is written like this &lt;p&gt;</p>
        <!-- &lt; prints less than symbol and &gt prints greater than symbol -->

        <p>Pound is written like this &pound; </p>
        <p>Copyright is written like this &copy;</p>
        <p>Another character is written like this &sect; </p>
        <p>Another character is written like this &frac14;</p>
